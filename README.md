# ff-2020-weekly

  This is a program that pulls up to the minute updates on NFL player news, injury updates, and transactions from Fantasy Pros [https://www.fantasypros.com/player-news.php]. It also pulls up to date analysis for fantasy football based on what the player update is. 

FF-2020-Weekly lists the last twenty(20) news/fantasy football updates. The program allows a user to type in the number of the update(1-20) to individually look at updates. These top twenty(20) change by the minute as updates come in and are updated on Fantasy Pros [https://www.fantasypros.com/player-news.php]. The fantasy updates show how the news update impacts the players fantasy impact for that week and possibly the rest of the NFL season. The fantasy impact pulls from a 'more news' link on the news update to pull a fantasy update from the players individual news page.
